# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using the TMDB movie dataset. The application is developed with Streamlit for both the frontend and backend. Categorical data columns were combined to create a unified "tags" feature, which was then vectorized using CountVectorizer. Cosine similarity was calculated on these vectors to determine movie similarity and generate relevant recommendations.
vector.pkl was not added to github due to size constraints
